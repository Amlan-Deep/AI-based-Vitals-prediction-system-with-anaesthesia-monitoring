# AI-based-Vitals-prediction-system-with-anaesthesia-monitoring

The present study focuses on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to predict vital signs
following the administration of anaesthesia. With the aim of enhancing patient care and safety
during surgical procedures, we sought to develop accurate and efficient models capable of
forecasting changes in essential physiological parameters like electrocardiogram (ECG) and
blood pressure (BP), in response to variations in anaesthesia dosage.

Leveraging a diverse dataset sourced from Yashoda hospitals and vitalDB, our investigation utilised deep learning architectures
such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Encoder-Decoder models.

The methodology involved mapping the vital sign data to the corresponding rate and volume of
anaesthesia administered, thereby establishing a relationship between anaesthesia dosage and its
impact on patient vitals. By employing these cutting-edge AI techniques, our models were
trained on extensive datasets, which allowed them to capture complex temporal dependencies
and patterns. We utilised a rigorous validation process to ensure the robustness and
generalizability of our predictions.

The results obtained through our experiments demonstrated promising performance, showcasing
the potential of AI-driven predictions in the anaesthesia domain. The models exhibited high
accuracy and precision, providing valuable insights into the dynamic responses of patients' vitals
to anaesthesia administration.
